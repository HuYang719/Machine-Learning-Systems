## Motivation

1.FL needs a large number of communication rounds

2.Cause a significant challenge in (i) bandwidth-limited or (ii) time-sensitive applications (connected vehicles or drones)

(i) bandwidth-limited: cause slow transmission, but there is no quantative results to evaluate the relationship between bandwidth and the transmission data size; furthermore, do we have anyother methods to improve (e.g. data/gradients compression?)

(ii) time-sensitive applicaitons, why cannot start learning process when they stop? We only need data and they could store data after finishing moving.



3. Clients can have unseen data compared to the preparation in the server, current method cannot tacle with this.

## Method

meta-train an initial model

## Experiments



Compare with R-round FedAvg algorithm on CIFAR-100, miniImageNet, FEMNIST.
