## Ideas

multimodel with Federated Learning: focus on heterogeneous data



## Writing

1. Firstly, data owners are **increasingly privacy sensitive**. 
2. Following privacy concerns among consumers in the age of big data, policy makers have responded with the implementation of **data privacy legislations** such as the **European Commission's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and **Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights** in the US.
3. Secondly, a cloud-centric approach **involves** long propagation delays and **incurs unacceptable** latency for applications in which real-time decisions have to be made, e.g., in self-driving car systems.
4. Thirdly, the transfer of data to the cloud for processing **burdens the backbone networks** especially in tasks involving unstructured data, e.g., in video analytics. 
5. The implementation of FL at mobile edge networks can thus naturally **leverage on the increasing computing power and wealth of data** collected by distributed end devices, **both of which are driving forces** contributing to the rise of DL.
6. This **deterioration in accuracy** is further shown to be quantified by the earth mover's distance (EMD), i.e., difference in FL participant's data distribution as compared to the population distribution.
7. The authors in [72] also find that **global imbalance,** i.e., the situation in which the collection of data held across all FL participants is **class imbalanced**, **leads to a** deterioration **in model accuracy**.
