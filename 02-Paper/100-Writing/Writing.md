- Substantial
  - These cross-silo applications have attracted substantial attention 
- Downside
  - The downside of this approach is that the 
- Encompass
  - This encompasses a myriad of possible approaches, including: developing better optimization algorithms; providing different models to different clients; making ML tasks like hyperparameter search, architecture search, and debugging easier in the FL context; imprving communication efficiency; and more.
- On the downside
  - 负面因素
  - On the downside, however, the information on a single worker only reaches its two adjacent neighbors in one round of communication
- We **theoretically** prove that ... attains a similar convergence rate as FedAbg, and **empirically** show that our algorithm can tolerate high network latency without compromising accuracy. 
- This **dwarfs** the performance of federated systems and slows the development of related applications
- Decentralized computational methods are distributed computational methods **running** without a centralized server.
- replace the rigid pipeline structure with randomized temporary "pipelines" formed **on the fly** during each iteration

Two reviewers focused on the static nature of the partitioning method. It seems like this new paper in IEEE access addresses this. Perhaps we need to think about how to expand our work to support dynamic partitioning. Isn't that a goal in any case?
