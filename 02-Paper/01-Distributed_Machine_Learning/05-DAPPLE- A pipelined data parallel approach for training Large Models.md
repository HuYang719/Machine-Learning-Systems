# DAPPLE: A Pipelined Data Parallel Approach for Training Large Models

## Problem，Motivation， importance

pipeline parallelsim for heterogeneous network and synchronization training

PipeDream solve for async but in practice, sync is important for convergence  

## Method

Pivot stage: the stage with the least bubble overhead

## My Comments

1. the equation (1) for T_s (steady phase) is not suitable for steady phase when communication large than computation
   $$
   T_s = (M-1)(F_Q+B_Q)
   $$
