## Summary

Define Federated Learning and FedAvg algorithm 



## Writing

1. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches.
2. Languae models, which can be used to improve voice recognition and text entry on touch-sceen keyboards by improving devoding, next-word-prediction, and even predicting whole replies.
3. Holding even an "anonymized" dataset can still put user privacy at risk via joins with other data.
4. Thus, our goal is to use additional computation in order to decrease the number of rounds of communication needed to train a model.
