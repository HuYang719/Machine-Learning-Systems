# BlueFog: Make Decentralized Algorithms Practical for optimization and Deep Learning

? What is their communication library? How many decentralized algorithm they support.

? Pull and Push Matrix 

## Problem，Motivation， importance

Area: Decentralized training algorithm

Problem: Lack of an easy-to-use and efficient software package 

**The recent development further involves asynchrony, time-varying network topologies, and asymmetric communication have created an even higher implementation barrier**

## Method



## Experiments

A much higher throughput about 1.2x ~ 1.8X speedup over horovod
